# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 9

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

#### What is this homework assignment about?

	-How to maintain parent pointers in a binary search tree
	-How to use parent pointers for traversal 
	-Removing nodes from a BST
	-Recursion 


### Gather

#### What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?

	-What do I know?
		-Recursion
		-Using a BST
		-How the data structure works
		
	-What do I need to know?
		-How to remove from a BST
		-Simplying methods with recursion



### Brainstorm

#### What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?

	-Using my resources 
	-Drawing out diagrams of how I expect test cases to work
	-Going through the whole homework PDF and navigating tree PDF
	-Using UnlockTest to better understand how the methods work
	-Plan out what I need to do, so I can have structure to follow


### Plan

#### What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?

	-Diagramming
	-Working on UnlockTest so I can better understand the structure
	-Implement missing methods
	-Working down "What do I need to do" 


*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review


#### Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties?

	- I correctly expected difficulties. I knew it was not going to be easy to remove parts from the BST and reassign children, parents. Some of the cases were easier to troubleshoot than others, but overall I knew it was not going to be the easiest and was going to take practice and diagramming. 


#### How did the plan go?

	-My plan went well. Since I have started attempting to diagram the methods and test cases it has been easier to have something to follow than just trying to code in circles. Like every week it was useful to go over UnlockTest, Piazza questions and any other information shared with us to get the best understanding of what needs to be accomplished before I start coding my methods in. 

### Preview

#### What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment?

	-I feel like I have a good hold on weekly plans for my assignments. I can continue to be detailed and making sure to stay ahead on my programs in case I run into issues. That way I will have time to debug without being stressed about an upcoming due date. It will be important to continue to diagram my methods and test cases, and making sure to use all the resources I have. 

#### Do I need more resources?
	
	-I do not need more resources. The resources I have now are great and it is on me now to apply them to the best of my ability.
